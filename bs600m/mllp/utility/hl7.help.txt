==========================================
MSA segment:
==========================================
Indicates whether the message was accepted (ie. processed successfully) or rejected. The first field of the MSA segment contains the acknowledge status, which is one of the following:
Acknowledge Status
	
Meaning
AA 	

Positive acknowledgment: the message was successfully processed.
AE 	

Application error: there is a problem processing the message. The sending application must correct the problem before attempting to resend the message.

AR
	

Application reject: there is a problem with field 9, field 11 or field 12 of the MSH segment of the incoming message, or there is a problem with the receiving application that is not related to the message or its structure.


AA	Original mode: Application Accept - Enhanced mode: Application acknowledgment: Accept	
AE	Original mode: Application Error - Enhanced mode: Application acknowledgment: Error	
AR	Original mode: Application Reject - Enhanced mode: Application acknowledgment: Reject	
CA	Enhanced mode: Accept acknowledgment: Commit Accept	
CE	Enhanced mode: Accept acknowledgment: Commit Error	
CR	Enhanced mode: Accept acknowledgment: Commit Reject



ack message
Control
The simple general acknowledgment (ACK) can be used where the application does not define a special application level acknowledgment message or where there has been an error that precludes application processing.  It is also used for accept level acknowledgments.  The details are described in Section 2.13.1, “Original and enhanced processing rules.”



Note: For the general acknowledgment (ACK) message, the value of MSH-9-2-Trigger event is equal to the value of MSH-9-2-Trigger event in the query message being acknowledged.  The value of MSH-9-3-Message structure for the general acknowledgment message is always ACK.
